PHP Exercises F2F Activity

PHP exercise 1

For your first PHP exercise, echo the following statement to the browser:
“Twinkle, Twinkle little star.”
Next, create two variables, one for the word “Twinkle” and one for the word “star”. Echo the statement to the browser, this time substituting the variables for the relevant words. Change the value of each variable to whatever you like, and echo the statement a third time. Remember to include code to show your statements on different lines.
PHP exercise 2

PHP includes all the standard arithmetic operators. For this PHP exercise, you will use them along with variables to print equations to the browser. In your script, create the following variables:
$x=10;
$y=7;
Write code to print out the following:
10 + 7 = 17
10 - 7 = 3
10 * 7 = 70
10 / 7 = 1.4285714285714
10 % 7 = 3
Use numbers only in the above variable assignments, not in the echo statements.
PHP exercise 3

Arithmetic-assignment operators perform an arithmetic operation on the variable at the same time as assigning a new value. For this PHP exercise, write a script to reproduce the output below. Manipulate only one variable using no simple arithmetic operators to produce the values given in the statements.
Hint: In the script each statement ends with "Value is now $variable."
Value is now 8.
Add 2. Value is now 10.
Subtract 4. Value is now 6.
Multiply by 5. Value is now 30.
Divide by 3. Value is now 10.
Increment value by one. Value is now 11.
Decrement value by one. Value is now 10.
PHP exercise 4

When you are writing scripts, you will often need to see exactly what is inside your variables. For this PHP exercise, think of the ways you can do that, then write a script that outputs the following, using the echo statement only for line breaks.

string(5) "Harry"
Harry
int(28)
NULL
